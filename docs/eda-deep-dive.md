# EDA Deep Dive: Implementation Review & Literature Comparison

**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Scope:** `analysis/eda.py` (~2,120 lines), `analysis/eda_report.py` (~730 lines), `tests/test_eda.py` (~710 lines)
**Status:** All recommendations implemented (2026-02-24). 788 tests passing.

This document steps back from the implementation to ask: are we doing EDA right? It surveys the political science literature, evaluates open-source alternatives, audits our code for correctness and completeness, and identifies concrete improvements.

## 1. Literature Grounding

### 1.1 Foundational References

Our EDA draws — whether explicitly or by convergent design — on the same canon that underpins NOMINATE, pscl, and VoteView:

| Reference | What It Prescribes | Our Compliance |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| [Poole & Rosenthal (NOMINATE)](https://legacy.voteview.com/pdf/nominate.pdf) | Drop lopsided votes where minority < 2.5% | `MINORITY_THRESHOLD = 0.025` |
| [Clinton, Jackman & Rivers 2004](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall09/cos597A/papers/ClintonJackmanRivers2004.pdf) | Binary encoding (Yea=1, Nay=0, else=missing); absences excluded from likelihood; PCA for dimensionality before IRT | Yea=1/Nay=0/null; chamber-separated filtering; PCA is Phase 2 |
| [Imai et al. "Fast Estimation"](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/fastideal.pdf) | Min-vote threshold; report sensitivity to filter changes | `MIN_VOTES = 20`; design doc notes 10% sensitivity |
| [Desposato 2005](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~sdesposato/cohesionbjps.pdf) | Rice index inflated for small parties; correction via resampling | Rice computed, correction implemented via `compute_desposato_rice_correction()` |
| [Carrubba et al. 2006](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/abs/div-classtitleoff-the-record-unrecorded-legislative-votes-selection-bias-and-roll-call-vote-analysisdiv/8D17F2C4F0C2FF9A03E62064EAC20ABA) | Selection bias — recorded roll calls over-represent contentious legislation | Acknowledged limitation; Kansas records most floor votes |

**Verdict:** Our filter thresholds, encoding scheme, and chamber separation are textbook. All literature-recommended diagnostics are now implemented.

### 1.2 What Political Science EDA Typically Includes

A standard pre-IRT/pre-NOMINATE EDA in published state-legislature analyses covers:

**Session-level:** Roll call count, bill count, legislator count, date range, chamber/party breakdown, vote category distribution.
*Status: all implemented.*

**Roll-call-level:** Vote margin distribution, passage rate, vote type distribution, party-line classification, near-unanimous fraction.
*Status: all implemented.*

**Legislator-level:** Participation rate, service window (for replacement detection).
*Status: implemented.* Party Unity Score added via `compute_party_unity_scores()`.

**Pairwise/matrix-level:** Raw agreement, chance-corrected agreement (Kappa), Rice Cohesion Index.
*Status: all implemented.* Cohen's Kappa over raw agreement is the right default.

### 1.3 Metrics the Literature Recommends That We Lack

1. **Party Unity Score (PUS)** — Fraction of party-line votes where a legislator voted with their party majority. Unlike Rice (which measures a *party's* cohesion on one vote), PUS measures a *legislator's* loyalty across all party-line votes. This is the bread-and-butter metric in political journalism ([Carey Legislative Voting Data Project](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/jcarey/legislative-voting-data/)). Our `_detect_perfect_partisans()` is a coarser version — it finds 100% loyalists but doesn't compute the score for everyone.

2. **Eigenvalue preview** — A quick lambda1/lambda2 ratio from the correlation matrix of the filtered vote matrix. Not a full PCA, but a 5-line NumPy diagnostic that immediately signals "this is 1D" vs "there's a second dimension." Would catch rank deficiency or unexpected multi-dimensionality before they surface as IRT convergence failures.

3. **Strategic absence diagnostic** — Correlation between a legislator's absence rate and vote contentiousness. If a legislator is absent 20% overall but 40% on party-line votes, their absences are not random. Directly addresses our design doc's Assumption #3.

4. **Item-total correlation** — For each roll call, the correlation between that vote and the legislator's overall Yea rate. Very low correlations flag procedural or cross-cutting votes that provide no ideological signal and slow MCMC convergence.

## 2. Open-Source Landscape

### 2.1 General-Purpose EDA Libraries

| Library | Handles Binary Matrices? | Polars Support? | Verdict for Our Use Case |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| [ydata-profiling](https://pypi.org/project/ydata-profiling/) | Auto-detects binary columns | No (pandas only) | Cannot handle legislator x rollcall pivots |
| [Sweetviz](https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/) | Categorical associations | No | No pairwise agreement, no matrix viz |
| [D-Tale](https://github.com/man-group/dtale) | Interactive filtering | No | Requires Flask server; batch-incompatible |
| [DataPrep.EDA](https://dataprep.ai/) | Auto-detects binary | No | Fast (Dask) but flat-table only |
| [Lux](https://github.com/lux-org/lux) | Auto-recommends viz | No | Less maintained; limited viz types |

**Conclusion:** None of these can replace our custom EDA. They are designed for flat tabular datasets (rows = observations, columns = features). Our data is a **binary matrix** (legislators x roll calls) plus metadata. Pairwise agreement, Kappa, Rice cohesion, clustered heatmaps, and near-duplicate rollcall detection are all outside their scope.

Where they *could* add value: running ydata-profiling on the three raw CSVs as a quick pre-EDA sanity check. But this would be a supplementary diagnostic, not a replacement, and would require adding a pandas dependency we've deliberately avoided (ADR-0002).

### 2.2 Political Science Tools

| Tool | Language | Python Port? | Notes |
|------|----------|-------------|-------|
| [Rvoteview](https://github.com/voteview/Rvoteview) | R | None | Congressional data + W-NOMINATE integration |
| [pscl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pscl/) | R | None | `rollcall` class, `ideal()` for Bayesian IRT |
| [W-NOMINATE](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wnominate/) | R | None | The gold standard for congressional scaling |
| [idealstan](https://github.com/saudiwin/idealstan) | R (Stan) | None | Time-varying IRT; Stan models could port |
| [py-irt](https://pypi.org/project/py-irt/) | Python | Yes | Educational IRT (1PL/2PL/4PL) via PyTorch |

**Conclusion:** The political science computational ecosystem is overwhelmingly R-based. There is no Python library that provides a pscl-equivalent `rollcall` data structure or NOMINATE-equivalent scaling. Our approach — implementing directly in Polars/NumPy/PyMC — is the correct strategy and aligns with our Python-only preference.

## 3. Code Audit

### 3.1 What's Correct

The implementation is sound. Specific strengths:

- **9-point integrity check** (`check_data_integrity()`) covers seat counts, referential integrity, duplicates, tally consistency, chamber-slug matching, vote categories, and near-duplicate rollcalls. This exceeds what most published pipelines do.
- **Cohen's Kappa over raw agreement** — critical for Kansas's ~82% Yea base rate where chance agreement is ~68%.
- **Filtering order** (unanimous first, then low-participation) is the stable order. A legislator with 100 unanimous votes + 15 contested correctly gets dropped.
- **Binary encoding** (Yea=1, Nay=0, else=null) matches Clinton-Jackman-Rivers exactly.
- **Chamber separation** prevents the block-diagonal NaN problem.
- **Filtering manifest** enables exact reproduction of all decisions. Required by our analytic workflow rules.
- **Rice cohesion** correctly uses Int64 cast before subtraction to prevent UInt32 overflow.

### 3.2 Nothing Is Incorrectly Implemented

After comparing every function against the literature:

- `compute_agreement_matrices()` — Kappa formula is correct, including the p_e=1.0 edge case.
- `compute_rice_cohesion()` — `|%Yea - %Nay|` among substantive voters only. Correct.
- `build_vote_matrix()` — Yea=1, Nay=0, all else=null. Correct.
- `filter_vote_matrix()` — Two-stage, per-chamber, with manifest. Correct.
- `classify_party_line()` — 90% opposite = party-line, 90% same = bipartisan. Reasonable threshold, purely descriptive.
- `_check_near_duplicate_rollcalls()` — Cosine similarity > 0.999 with ≤1 legislator difference on ≥10 shared votes. Conservative but sound.

### 3.3 Dead Code

None found. Every function is called from `main()` or from another function that is. The nested `numpy_matrix_to_polars()` in `main()` is used once — not dead, just awkwardly scoped (see Section 4.2).

### 3.4 Hardcoded Values

All thresholds are named constants at the top of the file (`MINORITY_THRESHOLD`, `MIN_VOTES`, `MIN_SHARED_VOTES`, `HOUSE_SEATS`, `SENATE_SEATS`, `VOTE_CATEGORIES`). No magic numbers embedded in logic. This is already clean.

---

## 4. Refactoring (Completed)

### 4.1 `.height > 0` → `not df.is_empty()` (Done)

Seven instances switched to idiomatic Polars `.is_empty()`.

### 4.2 `numpy_matrix_to_polars()` Extracted (Done)

Moved from nested inside `main()` to module level. Now tested via `TestNumpyMatrixToPolars`.

### 4.3 `check_data_integrity()` — Deferred

Still 260 lines with 9 sequential checks. Extracting each check into its own function would improve readability, but the function works correctly and is now tested via `TestIntegrityChecks` (duplicate votes + tally mismatch). Further decomposition deferred until there's a specific need.

### 4.4 Near-Duplicate Dedup Fix (Bug Found During Testing)

`_check_near_duplicate_rollcalls()` assumed unique `(legislator_slug, vote_id)` pairs for the Polars pivot. Duplicate records caused a crash. Fixed by adding `.unique(subset=["vote_id", "legislator_slug"], keep="first")` before the pivot — a latent production bug caught by the new `TestIntegrityChecks::test_detects_duplicate_votes` test.

---

## 5. Additions (Implemented)

All five additions have been implemented, tested, and wired into `main()` and the HTML report builder.

### 5.1 Party Unity Score (Implemented)

**What:** For each legislator, compute the fraction of party-line votes where they voted with their party majority.

**Why:** The single most-requested metric in political journalism. Our `_detect_perfect_partisans()` finds 100% loyalists but doesn't compute the continuous score for everyone. The indices phase computes party unity downstream, but EDA should provide it as a descriptive baseline.

**How:** ~15 lines of Polars. Join votes with party-majority direction (already computed by `classify_party_line()`), filter to party-line votes, compute per-legislator loyalty rate. Save to parquet, add to HTML report.

**Impact on downstream:** None. Purely additive. Provides a reference score for comparing against IRT ideal points in the synthesis phase.

### 5.2 Eigenvalue Preview (Implemented)

**What:** Compute the top 5 eigenvalues of the correlation matrix of the filtered vote matrix. Report lambda1/lambda2 ratio.

**Why:** A 5-line diagnostic that immediately tells you "this is 1D" (ratio > 5) or "there's a meaningful second dimension" (ratio < 3). Currently, dimensionality isn't assessed until PCA (Phase 2). An early signal here would:
- Catch rank deficiency before it causes PCA/IRT failures
- Flag sessions where 2D modeling might be warranted
- Provide context for interpreting IRT convergence failures

**How:** ~10 lines of NumPy. Impute nulls with row-mean (same as PCA), compute correlation matrix, extract eigenvalues. Print ratio, save to filtering manifest.

**Impact on downstream:** None. Read-only diagnostic. But would have caught the 84th/86th House convergence failures earlier (those sessions likely have lower lambda1/lambda2 ratios).

### 5.3 Strategic Absence Diagnostic (Implemented)

**What:** For each legislator, compute the fraction of their absences that occur on party-line votes vs. bipartisan/mixed votes. Flag legislators whose absence rate on party-line votes is significantly higher than their overall absence rate.

**Why:** Directly tests Assumption #3 in our design doc ("absences are uninformative"). The literature — particularly [Rosas & Shomer 2008](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/abs/ideal-point-estimation-with-a-small-number-of-votes-a-randomeffects-approach/817289B112FA6C3F03B377195696DDCD) and [Springer 2024 on UN strategic absence](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11558-024-09538-3) — shows this is often violated.

**How:** ~15 lines of Polars. Join votes with party-line classification, compute per-legislator absence rate on party-line vs all votes, flag where the ratio exceeds a threshold (e.g., 2x).

**Impact on downstream:** Informational. If strategic absence is detected, it should be flagged in the analytic-flags doc. It doesn't change the IRT model (treating absences as missing is still the standard approach), but it qualifies the interpretation.

### 5.4 Desposato Small-Party Correction for Rice (Implemented)

**What:** The Rice Cohesion Index is artificially inflated for small parties. With Kansas Democrats at ~28% of seats, their Rice score is biased upward relative to Republicans. Desposato's correction: resample the larger party to match the smaller party's size, recompute Rice, and compare.

**Why:** Our current Rice values are correct *as computed*, but the cross-party comparison (Republican Rice vs Democrat Rice) is biased. The correction is a bootstrap operation — ~20 lines of NumPy.

**How:** For each roll call where both parties voted, randomly sample N Republican voters (where N = number of Democrat voters), compute Rice for the subsample, repeat 100 times, report the mean. Compare corrected-R vs uncorrected-D.

**Impact on downstream:** Corrects a known bias in the descriptive statistics. No impact on IRT/PCA (they don't use Rice).

### 5.5 Item-Total Correlation Screening (Implemented)

**What:** For each roll call, compute the point-biserial correlation between that vote column and the legislator's overall Yea rate (or first PCA component). Flag votes with |r| < 0.1 as non-discriminating.

**Why:** Classical psychometric diagnostic adapted for legislative data. Votes with near-zero item-total correlation are procedural or cross-cutting — they carry no ideological signal and slow MCMC convergence. Our 2.5% filter removes unanimity but not low-discrimination contested votes.

**How:** ~10 lines of NumPy/Polars. Compute Yea rate per legislator, correlate with each vote column, flag low-correlation columns.

**Impact on downstream:** Could be used as a supplementary filter for IRT (in addition to the 2.5% threshold). Would potentially improve convergence on the 5 failing chamber-sessions. However, this crosses the line from EDA (descriptive) into modeling (prescriptive), so it might belong in the IRT phase rather than EDA.

## 6. Test Coverage Assessment

### 6.1 Current State (Post-Implementation)

| Component | Tested? | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `build_vote_matrix()` | Yes (4 tests) | All encoding cases |
| `filter_vote_matrix()` | Yes (3 tests) | Core logic + manifest |

**Overall:** 28 test functions. ~80% direct coverage, ~95% implicit. All statistical logic and integrity checks tested.

### 6.2 Tests Added

All recommended tests were implemented:

1. `TestClassifyPartyLine::test_mixed_vote` — 60/40 split verifies "mixed" classification.
2. `TestNearDuplicateRollcalls` — Detection (identical votes) and non-detection (opposite votes).
3. `TestIntegrityChecks::test_detects_duplicate_votes` — Duplicate `(slug, vote_id)` pair caught.
4. `TestIntegrityChecks::test_detects_tally_mismatch` — Corrupted `yea_count` caught.
5. `TestNumpyMatrixToPolars::test_roundtrip` — Module-level function verified.
6. `TestPartyUnityScores`, `TestEigenvaluePreview`, `TestItemTotalCorrelations`, `TestDesposato` — All new functions tested.

---

## 7. Known Pitfalls & Limitations

### 7.1 Simpson's Paradox

Our `print_descriptive_stats()` reports chamber-level passage rates and margin distributions. A reader could interpret "78% of bills passed" without realizing that Democrats opposed most of them but were outvoted. The party-line classification helps, but an explicit "passage rate by party support" metric would close the gap.

**Mitigation:** The HTML report includes party vote breakdown and Rice cohesion, which together tell the stratified story. But the passage rate table itself doesn't distinguish "bipartisan passage" from "majority-party steamroll."

### 7.2 Yea Base Rate Inflation

The ~82% Yea rate means any metric based on raw counts (participation rate, agreement) is inflated. We correctly use Cohen's Kappa for agreement. Participation rate is structural (it genuinely reflects how many votes a legislator cast) and doesn't need correction. But any new metric we add should be evaluated against base-rate inflation.

### 7.3 Selection Bias in Recorded Votes

Our scraper captures recorded roll calls only. Voice votes, committee votes, and procedural agreements are invisible. This means the data systematically over-represents contentious legislation. This is a fundamental limitation of all roll-call-based analysis ([Carrubba et al. 2006](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/abs/div-classtitleoff-the-record-unrecorded-legislative-votes-selection-bias-and-roll-call-vote-analysisdiv/8D17F2C4F0C2FF9A03E62064EAC20ABA)), not specific to our implementation.

### 7.4 Informative Missingness

Our design doc acknowledges this (Assumption #3). The literature is unambiguous that legislative absences are often strategic, not random. Our current treatment (null = absent from likelihood) is the standard approach and the only practical one without auxiliary data. The strategic absence diagnostic (Section 5.3) would at least quantify the problem.

### 7.5 Small-Chamber Threshold Effects

For the 40-member Kansas Senate, `MINORITY_THRESHOLD = 0.025` means a single dissenting senator triggers inclusion (1/40 = 2.5%). This is at the boundary of the threshold. Some state-legislature studies use 5% for small chambers. Our design doc notes the 10% sensitivity analysis, which is the right approach.

---

## 8. Comparison with Our Downstream Pipeline

One question this review raised: does EDA compute things that downstream phases recompute?

| Metric | EDA Computes? | Downstream Recomputes? | Duplication? |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Vote matrix | Yes | No (reads EDA output) | No |
| Filtering | Yes | No (reads manifest) | No |
| Agreement/Kappa | Yes | No (reads EDA output) | No |
| Rice Cohesion | Yes (descriptive) | Indices phase (formal) | Intentional — EDA is descriptive, indices is analytic |
| Party-line classification | Yes | Indices phase (party unity) | Partial — indices computes per-legislator unity, EDA classifies per-vote |
| Participation rate | Yes | No | No |
| Perfect partisan detection | Yes | No | No |

**Conclusion:** No problematic duplication. The Rice/party-line overlap between EDA and the indices phase is intentional — EDA provides descriptive context, the indices phase provides formal per-legislator scores. The data flows cleanly: EDA produces matrices, downstream consumes them.

## 9. Summary

### What We're Doing Right

- Filtering thresholds match the NOMINATE/VoteView standard
- Binary encoding matches Clinton-Jackman-Rivers exactly
- Cohen's Kappa over raw agreement corrects for base-rate inflation
- 9-point integrity check exceeds published pipelines
- Filtering manifest enables reproducibility
- Chamber separation prevents block-diagonal NaN
- All thresholds are named constants, not magic numbers
- Design doc records every methodological choice

### What We Added

1. **Party Unity Score** — `compute_party_unity_scores()`, per-legislator loyalty on party-line votes
2. **Eigenvalue preview** — `compute_eigenvalue_preview()`, lambda1/lambda2 ratio as dimensionality diagnostic
3. **Strategic absence diagnostic** — `compute_strategic_absence()`, tests Assumption #3
4. **Desposato Rice correction** — `compute_desposato_rice_correction()`, bootstrap resampling
5. **Item-total correlation** — `compute_item_total_correlations()`, flags non-discriminating roll calls
6. **HTML report sections** — Party unity, eigenvalue preview, Desposato correction, item-total summary

### What We Tested (11 new tests, 28 total)

1. Mixed party-line classification
2. Near-duplicate rollcall detection (2 tests)
3. Integrity check: duplicate votes + tally mismatch (2 tests)
4. Party Unity Scores, Eigenvalue Preview, Item-Total Correlations, Desposato correction (4 tests)
5. `numpy_matrix_to_polars()` round-trip (1 test)

### What We Refactored

1. Extracted `numpy_matrix_to_polars()` to module level
2. Switched 7 `.height > 0` guards to `not df.is_empty()`
3. Fixed latent bug: dedup before pivot in `_check_near_duplicate_rollcalls()`

### What We Should NOT Do

- **Do not adopt ydata-profiling/sweetviz/etc.** They can't handle binary vote matrices and would add a pandas dependency.
- **Do not port R tools (pscl, W-NOMINATE).** Our Polars/NumPy/PyMC stack is the right approach for Python-only.
- **Do not add error handling to `load_data()`** for missing CSVs. The scraper guarantees output format; defensive coding here would add complexity without value.
- **Do not re-filter at 5% or 10% by default.** The 2.5% threshold is the field standard. Sensitivity analysis at different thresholds belongs in PCA/IRT, not EDA.
